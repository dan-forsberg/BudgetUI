* NewBudget
NewBudget is the main component here. It fetches default/standard entries from the API and renders NewCategories with the data.
Todo: allow user to add more categories at will

* NewCategory
NewCategory allows the user to input and change rows, it's first filled by default entries.
It automatically adds rows as the "table form" is filled.

** Clicking outside the container
When clicking outside the container it updates it's total, removes any empty rows and sorts the entries
If the category is Gemensamma it sends its total to gmenesamTotal.ts which is a Svelte store.
If the category is not Gemensamma and the first default entry row is "HALF_OF_GEMENSAMMA" it updates that row's value to the half of the total -/+ /x/ where /x/ is the value that the default row had. This allows for evening out the common costs.
